# Distribution-induced Bidirectional GAN for Graph Representation Learning
This is a TensorFlow implementation of the Distribution-induced Bidirectional GAN (DBGAN) model as described in our paper. Some of the code is borrowed from T. N. Kipf, M. Welling, Variational Graph Auto-Encoders[https://github.com/tkipf/gae] and Hu. R, ARGA [https://github.com/Ruiqi-Hu/ARGA]

## Introduction
This code contains two versions of the hyper-parameters. The first one is the implementation of node clustering task. The second one is the implementation of link prediction task.
